# Stock Analysis

## Overview of Project:
* The purpose behind this project was to run a stock analysis from the year 2017 to 2018 by refactoring the Module 2 solution code to return the volume of the stock prices. Steve and I figured out which stocks were the most promising to have his parents invest in.

## Results:

In 2017, it is evident that nearly all stocks experienced positive returns for the trading year, with only one exception. Notably, four stocks yielded returns exceeding 100%. However, it is important to note that basing investment decisions solely on this particular year could pose challenges, as the subsequent year, 2018, presented a completely contrasting results.

In analyzing the stock returns for 2018, it becomes apparent that the majority of stocks exhibited negative performance. With the exception of ENPH and RUN, all other stocks incurred losses throughout the year. These two stocks, ENPH and RUN, may represent the most favorable investment options for Steve's parents. 


## Summary:
* Some advantages of refractoring code will allow processes to run faster and help cut down steps for other coders.  The only downside to refractoring code is that it will take coders extra time with rewriting the intial code by testing and debugging errors along the way.

* I notieced that the original VBA script ran slower than the refracted code. Also, along the way I spent alot of time editing the code and fixing my errors.
